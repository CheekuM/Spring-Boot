--Richardson Maturity Model--

Level 0
expose soap webservices in rest style
    - It means url/ resource name should be kind of the activity which we need to perform with the api
    For eg. Suppose we want to get the data - url should be named like this http://server/getData
    Same for delete .. Url should be named like http://server/deleteData

Level 1
expose resources with proper URI
    - http://server/accounts
      http://server/accounts/10

Level 2 = Level 1 + http methods

Level 3 = Level 2 + Hateoas(data+next possible action)

Best Practices
Consumer First
- Understand the naming of the customer
- Have great documents for the api - Swagger
- Make the best use of Http Method provides
- Use best use of the Request Methods
- Ensure sending proper response status
- Ensure no secure info in URI
